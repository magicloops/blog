## **tl;dr**

> We've switched _back_ to a credit-based pricing model

## Background

Earlier this year we moved from a credit-based pricing model to a run-based pricing model.

The idea was simple: let's make running Loops as straightforward as possible.

Long story short, it backfired!

Power users felt limited by the number of runs per month. New users felt the system was too opaque and didn't understand the pricing.

## Back to the Credits

Thankfully, we never removed the credit tracking within Magic Loops, so switching back was easy.

We did change a few things though:

### Transparent Pricing

Every dollar is 1000 credits.

Previously, you would get X credits for Y dollars. This was confusing.

Now you get X \* 1000 credits for X dollars. Simple.

### Fair Value

We charge 30% on top of the APIs and services we use.

Same as the App Store. That's it.

## Plans to the Future

We have 3 plan types:

1. Free
2. Paid
3. Enterprise

### Free as in üçª

The free plan... is free.

You get 3000 credits per month ($3) to run whatever Loops you want.

_Note: in the future we'll likely increase the free tier value but also make your Loops public by default. Thanks for the idea v0.dev üòà_

### Paid as in üí∏

We have 4 paid tiers:

1. Hobby - $9/month - 9000 credits

2. Professional - $20/month - 20k credits

3. Developer - $50/month - 50k credits

4. Startup - $300/month - 300k credits

You can run as many Loops as you want as many times as you want. No limits other than credits.

### Enterprise as in üîê

Want to run Magic Loops internally? We got you.

- Desire total control?
- Need to run Magic Loops on-prem?
- Require SOC 2 compliance?

[Contact us](mailto:sales@magicloops.dev) and we'll get you set up with a custom plan that fits your usage.

## Doesn't it cost money to create Loops?

Yes, it costs us money ($$$) to create Loops on your behalf.

_Why would you give that away for free?_

We can't, forever.

Magic Loops is [beta software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta), and while we're ironing out the kinks and making the product better, we don't want to limit the creativity of our users.

_Ok, but it also costs $$$ to run Loops, why have a free tier?_

With the introduction of [GPT-4o mini](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-intelligence/), using large language models within Loops is now cheaper than ever. We want to expose our (what we think is awesome, you [tell us](mailto:humans@magicloops.dev)) software to the world, and continue to have our users surprise us with what they build.

At some point, we'll need to lock all this down.

Until then, [go build some Loops!](https://magicloops.dev)
