description: Combine LLMs and code to create simple automations
---

Howdy! We‚Äôre Adam and Mihai from Magic Loops ‚Äî a new way to program computers using generative AI.

### **tl;dr**

Magic Loops combine LLMs and code to make simple automations easy to build and run.

### **üôà The Problem**

You want to automate a repetitive task or workflow.\
Today, you‚Äôre likely:

1. Attempting to use a **no-code/low-code** tool but struggling with **limitations**
2. Trying to use **ChatGPT** but struggling with **numbers and repeatability**
3. **Calling an engineer** because you‚Äôre in over your head

### ü™Ñ **Magic Loops** ‚û∞

Simply describe your task and we‚Äôll generate a loop that uses a combination of code and LLM ‚Äúblocks‚Äù to handle your workflow.

We give you full control over the loop, allowing you to change and modify it until it fits your needs.

You can run the loop at set times or by sending an email or webhook. Each loop can utilize code, LLMs, integrations, and APIs. The output of each loop is a text message, email, or webhook.

Once you've tested your loop, hit publish and we‚Äôll host it for you.
