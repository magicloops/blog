Magic Loops are the fastest way to combine LLMs and code to create simple automations.

Our goal is to give everyone the superpower of programming, without having to learn how to code.

We think no-code and low-code tools are too limiting, while full-code IDEs are often too complex, even for CS students.

Magic Loops bridge the gap between both extremes, married together with the use of state-of-the-art generative AI.        


## Tech Stack

Magic Loops run on AWS, and utilize a variety of 3rd party APIs to perform tasks on your behalf. We use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 from OpenAI for our "LLM Blocks", Twilio for our "Send SMS Blocks", and a number of included API providers to fetch data for weather, finance, news data, and more.

We're planning to open-source Magic Loops soon. If you're interested in running Magic Loops locally, [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/78DJrRtwfW) and let us know what you want to build!

## Features

Magic Loops are just code, and almost anything you can do with code, you can do with Magic Loops. 

Here are some example usecases:

- **ChatGPT automations**
  - _email summarizer, tag classifier, daily meditations, etc._
- **Text and email notifications**
  - _"notify me when TSLA is up more than 5%"_
- **Custom API endpoints**
  - _we support REST ()GET, POST, etc._
- **Web scraping**
  - _"send me the top 5 stories on Hacker News"_
- **System-to-system integrations** 
  - _connect Cloudflare to Mixpanel_
- **Background tasks** 
  - _e.g. when user signs up, update CRM, send welcome email, invite to Slack_
- **GPT Actions** 
  - _use Magic Loops to empower OpenAI's GPTs_
- **Discord Bots**
  - _[example haiku bot](https://github.com/magicloops/discord-bot)_
- **...and more! (surprise us!)**
