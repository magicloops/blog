Magic Loops are the fastest way to combine LLMs and code to create simple automations. 

Our goal is to give everyone the superpower of programming, without having to learn how to code.

We think no-code and low-code tools are too limiting, while full-code IDEs are often too complex, even for CS students.

Magic Loops bridge the gap between both extremes, married together with the use of state-of-the-art generative AI.

## Tech Stack

Magic Loops run on AWS, and utilize a variety of 3rd party APIs to perform tasks on your behalf. We use GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 from OpenAI for our "LLM Blocks", Twilio for our "Send SMS Blocks", and a number of included API providers for fetching data for weather, finance, news data, and more.

## Features

Magic Loops are just code, and almost anything you can do with code, you can do with Magic Loops. 

- ChatGPT automations (e.g. daily meditation prompt)
- text and email notifications (e.g. TSLA stock up more than 5%)
- custom API endpoints (GET, POST, etc.)
- web scraping (e.g. send me the top 5 stories on Hacker News)
- system integrations (e.g. connect Cloudflare to Mixpanel)
- background tasks (e.g. when user signs up, update CRM, send welcome email, invite to Slack)
- GPT Actions (use Magic Loops to empower GPTs)
- Discord Bots
- ...and more! (surprise us!)
